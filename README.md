Dotfiles
====

Highly opinionated Ubuntu & OS X system configuration.

Use case:

Engineer uses Ubuntu as home workstation and Macbook on the go.
It's hard to keep both environments in sync in terms of data and configuration.

I will try to make most scripts configurable but it's probably best to fork this repo and adjust to your own use case.

==

```
git clone https://github.com/xiwenc/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
~/dotfiles/install.sh
```

Components
==

- i3
